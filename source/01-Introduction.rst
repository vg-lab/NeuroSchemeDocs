NeuroScheme Introduction
========================

**NeuroScheme** is a visual exploratory framework that facilitates the process of knowledge extraction from complex neural scenes. This framework contains a multilevel structure, following the different organizational levels of the brain. Schematic or iconic symbols have been designed to portray the entities at each level, providing graphical representations that emphasize relevant features while hiding less important information. These schematic views, together with a multilevel organization, allow the exploration of the brain at different scales, combining in the same view different levels of abstraction whose entities can be either schematically represented (at different abstraction levels) or geometrically depicted at the finest level of detail.

--------------------------
NeurScheme synchronization
--------------------------

For NeuroScheme synchronization with other applications a ZeroEQ discovery provider must be installed in the machine. ZeroEQ applications are linked using automatic discovery based on ZeroConf protocol or through explicit connection addressing using hostname and port because of that a service like Avahi on Linux or dnssd on Mac/Windows (like `Bonjour <https://developer.apple.com/bonjour/>`_) must be installed. If that service is not present NeuroScheme will still be usable but won't be able to synchronize events or selection data.
